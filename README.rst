Configuration file
==================

You can store frequently used options in a configuration file. Create a
file at :code:`~/.config/addic7ed` (Linux, OSX) or
:code:`%APPDATA%/Addic7ed Configuration.txt` (Windows), and it will be
parsed using the Python ConfigParser (see example below). Hint: use the
:code:`--verbose` argument to print the full path of the configuration
file when running a command. It can contain three sections:

* [flags], to set a flag (verbose, hearing-impaired, overwrite, ignore,
  batch or brute-batch, see :code:`addic7ed search --help` for
  informations about those flags)

* [languages], to list prefered languages

* [session], the session to use for authentification (this is automatically
  populated when using :code:`addic7ed login`)

Example::

    [flags]
    hearing-impaired = no
    batch

    [languages]
    french
    english

    [session]
    abcdef

Video organizer
===============

video-organizer_ format is supported. If a "filelist" file is next to an
episode, it will use it to extract its real name and forge the good
query.
